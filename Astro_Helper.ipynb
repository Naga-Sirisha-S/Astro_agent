            "I see that you are in a state of confusion and distress due to the end of a relationship that was once significant in your life. It is natural to feel this way, as the heart often clings to what it has known and cherished. However, it is important to remember that change is a constant in this world, and sometimes, relationships must end for the growth and evolution of both parties involved.\n",

It is not for us to judge or speculate, but rather to accept the situation as it is and move forward with grace and understanding.\n",

By cultivating detachment, we can learn to find happiness within ourselves, regardless of external circumstances.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, the Gita teaches us the importance of non-violence. In this context, non-violence does not mean avoiding conflict or confrontation, but rather approaching difficult situations with compassion and understanding. Instead of harboring resentment or anger towards your ex-partner, try to see things from their perspective and offer them kindness and forgiveness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thirdly, the Gita teaches us the importance of selfless action. Instead of focusing on your own desires and needs, try to think of how you can serve and support your ex-partner in their journey, even if that means from a distance. This can help you to maintain a sense of connection and closure, while also allowing you to move forward with your own life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the Gita teaches us the importance of surrender to a higher power. In this case, that higher power could be the divine will or the natural course of events. By surrendering to this higher power, we can learn to trust that everything happens for a reason and that there is a greater plan at work.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, my dear disciple, I encourage you to approach this situation with detachment, non-violence, selfless action, and surrender. By doing so,\n"

It is natural to feel this way, as the heart often clings to what it has known and cherished.

Instead of focusing on your own desires and needs, try to think of how you can serve and support your ex-partner in their journey, even if that means from a distance. This can help you to maintain a sense of connection and closure, while also allowing you to move forward with your own life.\n",

            "Finally, the Gita teaches us the importance of surrender to a higher power. In this case, that higher power could be the divine will or the natural course of events. By surrendering to this higher power, we can learn to trust that everything happens for a reason and that there is a greater plan at work.\n",
